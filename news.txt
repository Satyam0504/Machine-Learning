ISLAMABAD: The already pro-India America under Donald Trump is expected to pressurize Pakistan to limit its nuclear and strategic missile programme, which has been the urge of the Obama administration but it failed to achieve it because of Islamabad’s plain and unambiguous “No”.

During his pre-election campaign, Trump had spoken, a few times, negatively about Pakistan’s nuclear programme. Once he said that he would want US forces to stay in Afghanistan to ensure that Pak nukes do not go into the hands of extremists.

In an interview in April this year, Trump had termed Pakistan "a vital problem" for the United States (US) "because they have a thing called nuclear weapons", adding, "They have to get a better hold of the situation." Trump also hinted at seeking help from India and other nations to address the “problem” of nuclear-armed Pakistan.

What Trump had said about Pakistan’s nuclear and strategic programme, is already the policy of US administration which under Obama had pressed Pakistan to limit its nuclear and strategic missile programme. With Trump getting into the Oval Office, this pressure is expected to mount on Pakistan.

Sources said that during Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s last year official visit to the United States, President Obama had asked the premier to limit its strategic defence programme. Nawaz Sharif was told that in case Pakistan cooperates and limits its strategic programme, Washington would consider recognizing Islamabad as a nuclear-weapon state. But it was not acceptable to Islamabad.

As already reported by this newspaper last year, the issue was bone of contention between the two countries even before the PM had landed in US. Such was the pressure that Pakistan had told the US administration of the possible cancellation of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s visit to the US to counter Washington’s intent to seriously dent Islamabad’s nuclear and defence strategic programme.
